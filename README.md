# data2viz Python

The notebook contains python implementations of all plots in the data2viz story trees which were originally implemented in R

Note that some plots (made using plotly) which are interactive don't show up when opened in github.

These plots can be accessed by opening the colab file : [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1caiTKzU4tH_mEuWsqBdTVsgNlWgDcddV?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1caiTKzU4tH_mEuWsqBdTVsgNlWgDcddV?usp=sharing)
